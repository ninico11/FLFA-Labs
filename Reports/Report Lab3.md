# Topic: Determinism in Finite Automata. Conversion from NDFA 2 DFA. Chomsky Hierarchy.

### Course: Formal Languages & Finite Automata
### Author: Rotaru Ion 

## Objectives:
  1. Understand what lexical analysis [1] is.
  2. Get familiar with the inner workings of a lexer/scanner/tokenizer.
  3. Implement a sample lexer and show how it works.
## Implementation
## Conclusion
In this laboratory work I learned and implemented converter from NFA to DFA or from FA to Regular Grammar. 
I learned how to determine if an FA is deterministic or non-deterministic. I found out the steps to convert an NDFA to a DFA
